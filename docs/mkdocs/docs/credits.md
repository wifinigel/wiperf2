# Credits
This project has had some great input from a number of people. Here are a few words of thanks to those who have been so generous in helping out.

Thanks to [Kristian Roberts](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/krisalexroberts) for his invaluable project input, testing and guidance on Splunk. He kicked this whole thing off and it definitely wouldn't have happened without him. A top bloke.

Thanks also to Eric Garnel and James Whitehead for their invaluable help in providing me so many Grafana dashboard files to "borrow" from. It was a steep learning curve for me, but the generosity of Eric & James really helped me to get to grips with Grafana. Also thanks to Eric for providing the idea to use InfluxDB as a data source (....even if I did use the wrong version initially! Lol). 

The code for the MOS score calculation was kindly provided by Mario Gingras. What a great idea...I wish I'd thought of that! Thanks Mario, it's great addition.
